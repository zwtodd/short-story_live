# short-story_live
A short story by reddit user CroatianSpy.
"Live" can be read here: http://bit.ly/2ruFrOV

## Why
I wanted to play around with some design elements, and decided to see if I could emulate the flow of a story with a very simple design. So I went to /r/writingprompts on reddit and chose a recently posted story. This one was very well written and received, and I enjoyed it, so I went with it.

## License Notes

The design elements and code for this project are licensed under MIT. The story itself ("Live") is written by and copyrighted by /u/CroatianSpy. It should not be further released without his/her permission. /u/CroatianSpy can be reached via reddit. I am not profitting off of this software, nor is it hosted anywhere else but on github for my own educational means.
